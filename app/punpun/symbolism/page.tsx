      <h1>Symbolism</h1>
      <h2>The bird</h2>
      <p>
        Disassociation with a beak. A cheap avatar that outsells the original.
        Drawn fast so you can read slow. The simpler the mask, the harder it is
        to take off.
      </p>
      <h2>Negative space</h2>
      <p>
        White isn?t empty; it?s pressure. Rooms breathe. Streets echo. Silence
        gets a panel and wins the scene.
      </p>
      <h2>Cosmic doodles and junk gods</h2>
      <p>
        Religion arrives as comic relief, then lingers like a headache. Faith is
        framed as a channel-surfing habit: you keep looking for something to
        watch you back.
      </p>
      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Corridors. Stairwells. Rooftops. Liminal spaces where decisions refuse
        to be made until they?re already over.
      </p>
      <h2>Sound without sound</h2>
      <p>
        Visual onomatopoeia. The page tells you how loud the pain is without
        saying a word. You hear it anyway.
      </p>
      <p className="muted">It?s not subtle. That?s why it works.</p>
