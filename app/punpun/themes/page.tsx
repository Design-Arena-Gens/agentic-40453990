      <h1>Themes</h1>
      <h2>Alienation as default setting</h2>
      <p>
        The self is a noisy room. You can leave, but you?ll only find another
        room with the same wallpaper. Punpun?s bird-mask is the visual gag that
        stops being a gag.
      </p>
      <h2>Romance as lie detector</h2>
      <p>
        The story treats love like a test for narratives we tell ourselves.
        Most fail. Some fail beautifully. That helps until it doesn?t.
      </p>
      <h2>Cycles of harm</h2>
      <p>
        Hurt echoes. Families transmit it like radio. The volume knob is hard to
        find and easy to break.
      </p>
      <h2>Faith, coincidence, and the quiet joke of fate</h2>
      <p>
        There are gods here, sort of. They arrive as intrusive thoughts in bad
        disguises. You can pray. You can also pick up the phone. One is faster.
      </p>
      <h2>Meaning vs. momentum</h2>
      <p>
        People confuse the two. The book doesn?t. Momentum feels like meaning
        until the wall. After the wall, you call it a lesson.
