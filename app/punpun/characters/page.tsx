      <h1>Characters</h1>
      <p>
        People don?t change much. Circumstances do. The book knows the
        difference and lets you watch the collision in slow motion.
      </p>
      <h2>Punpun</h2>
      <p>
        Drawn as a doodle so you can project, and so he can hide. The gap
        between how he sees himself and how the world sees him is the thesis and
        the joke. It stops being funny.
      </p>
      <h2>Aiko</h2>
      <p>
        A promise wrapped in static. Survival as personality. She wants out.
        The map is blank. She keeps walking.
      </p>
      <h2>Uncle Yuichi</h2>
      <p>
        A warning label with a pulse. Charisma that never pays the bill. Says
        he?s fine. He is not fine.
      </p>
      <h2>Mother, Father, Everyone Else</h2>
      <p>
        Adults doing adult impressions. Their damage is inherited like a
        surname. The book doesn?t excuse them. It also doesn?t grandstand.
      </p>
      <h2>Patterns, not portraits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Yearning scaled against reality: poor conversion rate.</li>
        <li>Love as escape plan: unreliable vehicle, frequent stalls.</li>
        <li>Shame as fuel: burns hot, eats the engine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="muted">No villains, just velocity. People go where their pain points.</p>
