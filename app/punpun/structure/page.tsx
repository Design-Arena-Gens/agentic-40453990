      <h2>Act drift, not act breaks</h2>
      <p>
        The story bleeds across boundaries. Childhood refuses to clock out.
        Adulthood shows up early. Scenes end two beats after the feeling does.
      </p>
      <h2>Rhythm</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Quiet slice-of-life. Breath in.</li>
        <li>Sudden absurdity. Breath held.</li>
        <li>Sharp drop into consequence. Breath out. Repeat.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Focal length</h2>
      <p>
        Close-ups for shame. Wide shots for fate. The cut tells you who?s in
        control. Spoiler: usually not the people on the page.
      </p>
      <h2>Time</h2>
      <p>
        Elastic. The past colonizes the present in little flashbulbs. Memory is
        edited out of order, which is to say: accurately.
      </p>
      <p className="muted">Resolution arrives. Closure does not. Accept both.</p>
    </article>
