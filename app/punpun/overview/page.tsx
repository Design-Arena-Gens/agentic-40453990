      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        It starts small. A kid. A family. An ordinary block where the mailman
        knows your name and the future doesn?t.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it doesn?t stay small. Scale is a trick here: tiny panels for big
        feelings, big panels for the void. The contrast is the point. Also the
        punishment.
      </p>
      <h2>What it actually is</h2>
      <p>
        A coming-of-age that refuses to end, a romance that never begins, a
        morality tale told by a shrug. The tone slides from silly to surgical in
        a breath. You laugh. Then the floor drops out.
      </p>
      <h2>How it moves</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Childhood: wishful myths; cheap optimism; the first cracks.</li>
        <li>Adolescence: grand plans; minor catastrophes; denial takes root.</li>
        <li>Adulthood: consequences with nice shoes; fate collects receipts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What it?s doing to you</h2>
      <p>
        It trains your eye to distrust relief. Jokes arrive like life rafts and
        sink on contact. Still, you grab them. We always do.
      </p>
      <h2>Why it works</h2>
      <p>
        The formal language is ruthless: stark black and white; negative space
        breathing like a second narrator; a protagonist drawn as a cartoon bird
        beside hyperreal people. Displacement as thesis. Alienation made visible.

        You wanted escape. You got a mirror. It?s fine. Keep reading.
