      <h1>Reading Guide</h1>
      <h2>Before you start</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Expect tonal whiplash. It?s deliberate.</li>
        <li>Humor is a flotation device. Use it. Don?t trust it.</li>
        <li>Take breaks. The book won?t. You should.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to read the visuals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Track panel size against emotion. Smaller often means louder.</li>
        <li>Notice when backgrounds disappear. Someone?s lying to themselves.</li>
        <li>Bird-Punpun is a temperature gauge. Simpler = colder.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What to watch for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Promises phrased as exits. They loop back.</li>
        <li>Adults outsourcing responsibility to fate. Fate is understaffed.</li>
        <li>Mirrors, thresholds, rooftops. Decisions migrate there to feel big.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>After</h2>
      <p>
        Don?t rush to explain it. Sit with the residue. Meaning will arrive on
        its own time, or it won?t. That?s also an answer.
      </p>

        If you recognized yourself, welcome. Everyone does. That?s the trick.
